Forbidden triple for stack generability.
Prove that a permutation can be generated by a stack (as in the previous question) if and only if it has no forbidden triple (a, b, c) such that a < b < c with c first, a second, and b third (possibly with other intervening integers between c and a and between a and b).

Solution:
a<b<c, c first, a second, and b third. if c is popped first, a and b are already in stack, and a is under than b, so a
can't be popped before b.
